  <div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid" id="vision">
    <div class="container">
      <h1 class="display-4">Our Vision:</h1>
      <hr class="my-4">
      <p>SimpliSell will be a classified advertisement platform designed to give students a centralized place to post
        and view local advertisements.</p>
      <p>The application will be akin to a digital bulletin board comprising of advertisements for a variety of
        different things. Users will be able to post advertisements to sell textbooks, devices like laptops, tickets to
        community/school events, tutoring services, or even information regarding student clubs or groups. They will
        also have the option to create "wanted" advertisements, such as in the case of looking for other students to
        carpool with. Users will be able to simply navigate through this list of existing ad postings, and will be able
        to easily obtain the advertiser's contact information for further communication.</p>
      <p>Users will be able to search for advertisements based on categories, while also having the ability to sort
        postings based on price. Users can save advertisements for later by adding specific postings to their watch
        list. A rating system will be put in place that will ask users to provide feedback on their interactions with
        other users. Additionally, users will be able to report inappropriate advertisements or users, which will be
        further investigated by an administrator.</p>
      <p>SimpliSell is designed primarily for students, so users will expect advertisements that are catered to their
        own desires and needs. Therefore, instead of having an overwhelming and abundant amount of unrelated
        advertisements, SimpliSell gives students a user-friendly platform that allows them to navigate through
        advertisements they are more likely to be interested in.</p>
      <p>To increase convenience for students, the application will be stationed within educational institutions to
        maximise exposure towards our targeted audience, which are students. To reflect this very demographic,
        advertisement postings will be classified according to various categories primarily tailored for items or
        services used in educational institutions. Students will also be able to post advertisements for anything
        related to their institution, such as volunteer groups or gatherings.</p>
      <p>The suitable location will prove advantageous to advertisers as well since the constant exposure to students
        may result in an increase in response rate and increase in sales. To further aid their effort, the always on
        display feature will scroll through all the existing ad postings so that students walking by the application can
        see them. With the rating system and reporting system built in the application, students can also feel at ease
        when doing business with trusted individuals on the platform.</p>
      <p>The application will be considered successful based on the following criteria. First, the majority of students
        prefer using SimpliSell over existing advertisement posting services, as determined by a survey. Second, users
        posting advertisements on the system see at least a 25% increase in genuinely interested responses compared to
        alternative platforms. Lastly, there is a demand for additional SimpliSell terminals within the current or other
        educational institutions.</p>

  <!-- Development Postmortem -->
  <div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid" id="postmortem">
    <div class="container">
      <h1 class="display-4">Development Postmortem:</h1>
      <hr class="my-4">
      <p>The development of SimpliSell was a rather smooth experience. Throughout the development process our team
        communicated regularly to one another via online chat programs and we had an in-person meeting at least once a
        week. Each member of the team took on an equal amount of work, and all were eager to get work done. When a team
        member was having difficulty with an assigned task they undertook, others were always available and willing to
        lend a hand. We did not have any major disagreements with the development process or priorities for the
        application, and any constructive criticism a team member received was taken seriously by that team member and
        rectified immediately. We attribute our communication and teamwork as the largest contributor to the success of
        our application.</p>
      <p>However the development process was not without any hiccups.</p>
      <p>The first problem we encountered was the issue with estimating work. No one in our development group had worked
        with the development tools in this project before. Therefore trying to estimate how much work that needs to be
        done, on a project you have no experience in, is difficult. Some tasks were highly over or under budgeted on
        time, leading some developers to have a misunderstanding on how much work had to be done. Thankfully our team
        was flexible and we regularly would re-distribute tasks mid development. Oddly enough, the over and under
        budgeting regularly evened out in the end, leading to an overall development time that was on track with overall
        estimates.</p>
      <p>Another issue was our commit schedule. We would regularly do our work locally and only commit to the origin
        branches on task completion. This was not an issue at most times, as some tasks were completely unrelated to one
        another. However, sometimes tasks needed parts of another task to be completed before they could be implemented.
        This was brought up in our iteration 2 retrospective, and will be discussed in more detail below.</p>
      <p>Lastly, while we communicated regularly about the tasks we would be doing. While development was underway more
        often than not we were silent about our work progress. This lead to some confusion in the middle of our
        iterations about what work has been completed and what is still left. This issue directly ties into the previous
        one. With more frequent commits, we would be indirectly communicating with the rest of the group on development
        progress more regularly.</p>
      <p>One of our iteration 2 retrospective areas of improvement was with the way we handle task distribution and
        updates to work being done. Sometimes, in order to start development on a task, the previous one relating to it
        would need to have been implemented or at least partially implemented. This lead to issues where developers
        could not start on their assigned work until the previous developer committed their finished implementation. We
        amended this problem in iteration 3 by carefully assigning tasks which should not overlap with other developers
        tasks if possible, breaking up tasks into smaller more manageable pieces, and also remind ourselves to commit
        early, and often. This change lead to a fluid development process for the final iteration of our project.</p>
      <p>We did have one bug tracked (marked as resolved now due to it being a known issue), which we are unsure how to
        even fix in its current implementation. Upon introducing the HSQLDB persistence layer, we started getting
        massive performance issues with our application. It is known that HSQLDB is rather slow on an android device,
        however on the physical device, it could at times take 10 seconds to log into the application. Some refactoring
        of redundant database calls did make a dent in this time, however it is still on the slow side. We believe
        perhaps implementing a different persistence back end would fix this. SQLite is native on android. If we could
        start this project over, we believe that moving to a native database implementation could drastically improve
        performance. We have discussed this with other teams currently using SQLite, and they state that performance has
        been a lot faster than what we are currently experiencing with HSQLDB.</p>
      <p>The original project vision has not changed since iteration 0. The only things that have changed would be
        re-prioritizing features and delaying the ones with the lowest priority due to time constraints. At the end of
        the project we completed 9 out of our originally planned 12 total features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User Login</li>
        <li>Advertisement Posting</li>
        <li>Searching</li>
        <li>Persistent Storage</li>
        <li>User Profiles</li>
        <li>Reporting</li>
        <li>Admin Controls</li>
        <li>Ad Expiry</li>
        <li>Reposting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The 3 features that did not get implemented are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automatic Advertisement Scrolling</li>
        <li>Watchlist</li>
        <li>Rating System</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As a team we have learned that large projects such as this require a great deal of clear communication. If we
        forgot to document something in detail while communicating in person, others can misinterpret what was agreed
        upon and lead to implementing something entirely different than expected. We found that we would hash out most
        ideas in person, then later on in the iteration there would be some confusion as to how exactly something is to
        be implemented. Whereas if we documented clearly during these discussions on what is to be done, there would be
        no confusion. This works best if you know how something should be implemented beforehand, but most things we
        were working with we had no idea how they would fit together until after we have gotten our hands dirty.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we as a team feel the most important aspect of working on a large project is communication. You
        can have an excellent idea for a project and have everything mapped out perfectly, from tasks to accurate
        estimates. However, poor communication can make a good project crumble to its knees. Most if not all of the
        issues we faced in the development of our project are solely due to communication errors. When we brought these
        issues to light during our retrospectives, development progress seemed to smooth out almost immediately. While
        we are disappointed that some features had to get cut that near the end of development, we are pleased with how
        the final iteration of the project came together. Everyone in the group pulled their weight, and we had a lot of
        fun along the way.</p>
