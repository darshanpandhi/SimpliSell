# Retrospective
Looking back on our previous iterations, we believe one part of the project that could have used some improvement was communicating with one another more consistently to ensure that we are all on the same page in regards of which features/user stories were completed.  Although this was a bigger issue in iteration 1, there were still a few instances  in iteration 2 in which certain fixes/changes were made on a particular feature which were not announced to everyone in the group.  A concrete example would be fixing a crash that occurred when a user decides to input a ‘.’ as an ad price.  One member was able to fix this issue, but did not tell the whole group.  On the very next day, another person decided to spend some time to fix it, not aware that the particular bug was already fixed.  Not communicating effectively and consistently will consequently lead to extra unnecessary work, and makes it more difficult to keep track on what else needs to be worked on.  As a result of suboptimal communication skills, we have noticed that we would finish the iteration only a few hours before the due date, and so we hope in this iteration, we would be able to finish much sooner.

To improve on this issue, we agreed for iteration 3, that we were going to meet right after every COMP 3350 class to go over what we worked on.  These meetings will be a way for everyone in the group to get on the same page, understand what each member will be doing in the current iteration, and ensure that we will be able to meet our deadlines.  We also decided to communicate more regularly on Slack, and to always message the group when new code has been pushed or when a new branch has been created.  Also, we decided that if anyone decides to fix an ongoing bug, that they would have to announce it in the group chat first before they could start working on it.

At the end of iteration 3, we will measure the success and effect of these changes based on 3 different criteria.  The first criteria is the number of slack messages should increase drastically and quantifiably increase at least twice as much.  Since communication is very important in any group setting, determining how many messages were sent to the group chat is a good indicator of how much communication is being done by members of the group.  Although the amount of slack messages sent is a good indicator of how much communication is being done, it does not necessarily mean that the group is communicating effectively. Therefore, the second criteria is the number of unnecessary work that was done due to a member not communicating what he has completed or worked on.  We hope that this number will be 0 as our constant meetings and communication through slack will hopefully prevent this issue from arising ever again in this iteration.  The third and final criteria would be the time we fully completed iteration 3.  Through constant communication and meetings, finishing all the assigned work at least 3 hours before the due date would mean that the concrete ways of improvement stated above have been successful.
