## Identified Issues/Bugs
[Low Performance](#118)

## Release notes - July 04, 2019
- Advertisement Posting, Search, Persistent Storage and User Profile features are now complete!  
- In addition to posting new ads, updating and deleting existing ads, users can now one-click repost ads that are about to expire. 
- One can also manage their list of ads and customize their profile by adding a *cool* profile picture. 
- The application now features a easy way to filter ads by type (Offering ads or Wanted Ads) or even sort them based on price.
- Existing users can reset their password in case they forget it by answering their own created security question.
- The application runs perfectly but is a bit slow on certain activites like logging in for instance due to HSQLDB. We have captured the bug in [Low Performance](#118) and will solve this in our next release.
- The Admin Control feature and the Reporting feature are pushed to iteration 3 as we underestimated the time and effort required to implement these. They should be included in our next release.
